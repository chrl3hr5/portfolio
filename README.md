## Work Experience
**Researcher @ Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Villarrica, Chile** | *Apr 2025 – June 2025* | *Internship*
  - Objectives:
    - Perform predictive analysis on retrospective quantitative and qualitative student data from the 2023 and 2024 cohorts to forecast results for the upcoming Examen de Comunicación Escrita (ECE) or the Written Communication Exam.
    - Establish criterion for grouping students based on prediction results to identify those students who require additional scaffolding in developing their academic language skills.

  - Data Analysis Process:
    - Data Preparation: Executed extensive data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality and readiness for modeling.
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify key factors, data distributions and potential relationships within the student dataset.
    - Multilevel Modeling Check: Assessed the presence of clustering in the student data to determine whether multilevel modeling was required.
    - Model Development: Implemented and compared three distinct predictive models:
      - Multilevel Linear Regression
      - Multilevel Bayesian Regression
      - Decision Tree

  - Outcomes:
    - Dashboard: Developed an interactive R Shiny dashboard to automate data analysis and prediction for future datasets. The dashboard’s functionality included highlighting student groups based on prediction results using charts and tables, presenting details of the predictive models and allowing users to re-train existing models with new data.
    - Presentation: Delivered a clear and engaging oral presentation of the findings to key stakeholders.
