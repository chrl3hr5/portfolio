- **Project Research Associate @ IIT Bombay, Mumbai | Jan 2022 – Nov 2022**
  - Implemented [interoperability between OpenModelica and Scilab via C](https://github.com/chrl3hr5/OMScilab) to call Scilab's FOSSEE Optimization Toolbox (FOT) functions from OpenModelica.
  - Implemented [interoperability between OpenModelica and R via C](https://github.com/chrl3hr5/OMR) to call R's general-purpose optimization functions from OpenModelica.
  - Added the feature of [Verilog to Ngspice conversion (NgVeri) in eSim 2.2](https://github.com/FOSSEE/eSim/blob/master/src/maker/NgVeri.py) by linking object files of Ngspice (C) and Verilator (C++).
- **Project Research Assistant @ IIT Bombay, Mumbai | July 2019 – Dec 2021**
  - Conducted online workshops on the [basics of Statistics](https://www.it.iitb.ac.in/nmeict/workshopContent.html?workshopid=l5rapSmiSkmObhISCLjV_w&category=UubpVTjA3FS-DQx8uW4rlA), [K-means Clustering](https://www.it.iitb.ac.in/nmeict/workshopContent.html?workshopid=zDEbCbywHBg5OPLFMDAadg&category=UubpVTjA3FS-DQx8uW4rlA), [LDA](https://www.it.iitb.ac.in/nmeict/workshopContent.html?workshopid=zDEbCbywHBg5OPLFMDAadg&category=UubpVTjA3FS-DQx8uW4rlA), [Data Visualization](https://www.it.iitb.ac.in/nmeict/workshopContent.html?workshopid=1iTsyg1QdVnqHaTmd7GKlg&category=UubpVTjA3FS-DQx8uW4rlA), and [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://www.it.iitb.ac.in/nmeict/workshopContent.html?workshopid=HLL0wA0XvfFFGsG5WdQrLA&category=UubpVTjA3FS-DQx8uW4rlA) using R.
  - Created academic lab coursework materials on [Linear Regression](https://r.fossee.in/lab-migration/lab-migration-run/6), [Artificial Neural Network](https://r.fossee.in/lab-migration/lab-migration-run/6), and [Statistical Quality Control](https://r.fossee.in/lab-migration/lab-migration-run/12) using R.
